# Fenix

Fenix is a powerful and easy to use project generator for Visual Studio Code

## Features

- Decentralized, you can create your own template repositories and share them!
- Fast, the interface supports filters and search, so you can have as many repos as you want and still find templates in a few seconds!
- Pinned templates, you can pin the templates you use more often and run them wihtout even opening the interface, they will use the variables you have set in your Fenix environment!
- Easy to develop templates, you can start with simple templates and learn your way to more complex ones!

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `fenix.repos`: List of repositories to fetch for templates
* `fenix.runCommands`: Templates can have a commands section, Fenix will ask by default if you want to run those commands, but you can set it to never run them, to always ask or to run them without asking (only recommended if you trust the template author).
* `fenix.env`: Object with stored Fenix variables that can be used in templates.
* `fenix.pinned`: List of all pinned templates.
